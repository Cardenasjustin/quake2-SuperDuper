You can choose your class with "c". You can activate each ability by pressing "f". There are big enemies that gain more health and become more difficult to kill the more you progress. Random items will also frequently spawn the player to help out. To install the mod you can complie the gamex86.dll into a new folder in your Quake 2 directory.
